// 1a. console.log the name of every person who responded to the survey


// 1b. console.log "Hi, my name is _____, and I live in ____." for every person who responded to the survey


// 2a. Create an empty array and name it shortBios. Inside of shortBios, create an object that stores each respondents name, nickname, and age. Then, console.log shortBios.



// 2b. Add the favorite show and favorite band to each person object inside of the shortBios array. Then, console.log shortBios.



// 2c. Create a new array called longBios. Inside of longBios, create an object that stores each respondents name, nickname, age, favorite show, favorite band, if they are a programmer, the state they live in, their hair color, and their personal bio. Then, console.log longBios.




// 3a. For each person in longBios, console.log a descriptor of where they live.
// It will look something like this: "____ lives in _____."




// 3b. console.log each person's nickname.
// BONUS: Write some control flow that determines whether / how to respond if someone didn't provide a nickname.




// 4. Find the average of the respondents' ages. Console.log this average (please use a loop, don't hard code the answer).




// 5. Print out the percentage of respondents who have brown hair. Console.log this percentage (please use a loop, don't hard code the answer).




// 6. Create two new arrays - one for programmers, and one for non programmers.
//    Sort all the people in the contacts array into these two more specific arrays.




// 7. Create a new array only for people who listed "Game of Thrones" as their one of their favorite shows.




// 8. Console.log a list of all the bands that are liked by at least two people.
//    Pro-tip: some respondents capitalized band names and other respondents did not, so for example, if Panic at the Disco isn't listed, your code isn't accurately reporting your results.



// EXTENSIONS //
// 9. Use the `.map()` method on the names array to create a new array called formattedNames which concatenates each name to an opening and closing `<h1>` tag.



// 10. Add each person's name to the webpage inside of the div with the id of "names."



// 11. Create a bio for each person and add it to the webpage inside of the div with the id of "biographies." Please use all the information about each person in this bio. For example: "_____, better know as _____ to friends currently lives in _____. ______'s motto is _______, which they heard on their favorite TV show ________." Be creative in the bio you create.
